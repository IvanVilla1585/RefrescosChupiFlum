History
=======

1.6.8
=====

* Made templatetags easier to subclass for special rendering behavior. Thanks
  to Christian Hammond.
* Updated the link to readthedocs. Thanks to Corey Farwell.
* Fixed some log messages to correctly refer to the new PIPELINE settings
  tructure. Thanks to Alvin Mites.
* Changed file outdated checks to use os.path methods directly, avoiding
  potential SuspiciousFileOperation errors which could appear with some django
  storage configurations.

=====

* Add a view for collecting static files before serving them. This behaves like
  django's built-in ``static`` view and allows running the collector for
  images, fonts, and other static files that do not need to be compiled. Thanks
  to Christian Hammond.
* Update documentation for the ES6Compiler to clarify filename requirements.
  Thanks to Nathan Cox.
* Add error output for compiler errors within the browser. This provides for a
  much better experience when compiling files from the devserver. Thanks to
  Christian Hammond.

=====

* Fix filtering-out of files which require a finder to locate.
* Allow compilers to override the output path.
* Fix error reporting when a compiler fails to execute.

  compressors. Thanks to Frankie Dintino.

  Dintino.
